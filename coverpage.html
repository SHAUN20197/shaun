    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>
            My passion for coding and graphic design stems from the powerful intersection of technology and creativity.<br>
            Coding allows me to solve complex problems and build innovative solutions,<br>
            while graphic design enables me to visually communicate ideas and enhance user experiences.<br>
            I love the challenge of translating abstract concepts into functional applications,<br>
            and I find immense joy in creating visually appealing interfaces that not only engage users but also provide intuitive navigation.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation and Support</h2>
        <p>
            My dedication to programming is greatly influenced by my parents,<br>
            whose unwavering support has been invaluable in my journey.<br>
            Their encouragement has been a driving force behind my passion for technology and design.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently seeking new employment opportunities to enhance my skills and support myself academically.
